            <h4>TransportationCamp brings together thinkers and doers in the fields of transportation &amp;
                technology.</h4>

            <p>TransportationCamp is a series of decentralized unconferences held throughout the world, where people of
                all backgrounds meet to discuss transportation-related topics. Each one is organized independently by
                their own local organizing committee, and may be held in conjunction with a larger conference or
                event.</p>

            <p>Attendees include students, young and experienced professionals, and community leaders from a wide range
                of backgrounds&mdash;including transportation planning, technology, innovation, and policy.</p>
