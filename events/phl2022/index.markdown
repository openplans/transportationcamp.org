<h1><center>The industry's first virtual conference is prepared for another great year on March 26, 2022!</center></h1>

![Scenes from TransportationCamp PHL 2019](/events/phl2018/Scenes%20from%20TCPHL18.jpg)

Whether you work in the industry or simply have an interest, we welcome you [in spirit] to our nation's birthplace at the center of the NEC for a day filled with ideas at the intersection of transportation, technology, and urbanism. As always, the participant-driven TransportationCamp conference series follows the "unconference" format, lending itself to a more pertinent, thought-provoking, and active event.

This is not your normal conference. **And it's NOT some webinars on a Saturday.**

Organized by passionate Philadelphians in conjunction with the Philadelphia Chapter and Mid-Atlantic Region of Young Professionals in Transportation (YPT), the Philadelphia Chapter of Women’s Transportation Seminar (WTS), and Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation, we look forward to seeing you!

## <a name="Logistics"></a> Logistics

Two years ago year, we pioneered the virtual model and proved successful and engaging events can be run from the safety and comfort of home.

Based on the current state of the pandemic, we are planning to repeat last year's plan, hosting:

- A **fully-virtual conference on March 26, 2022**; PLUS,
- **Another Summer Gathering** event which combines urban exploration and an outdoor happy hour during the warmer summer months

## <a name="firsttime"></a> First Time at a TransportationCamp?

Despite being virtual, this event will still follow the standard guidelines and practices from a normal TransportationCamp event. Here are some details.

- **How To TransportationCamp**: The folks at MobilityLab have taken the time to put together a [TransportationCamp 101 guide](http://transportationcamp.org/2011/02/how-transportationcamp-works-the-essential-guide/) that explains all aspects of the event.
- **Participation Encouraged**: Sessions are formed as the day goes on, so be sure to come with topics for discussion. If you have an idea, feel free to share and add your thoughts.
- **Rule of Two <s>Feet</s> Clicks:** Never hesitate to leave a session if you suddenly find it's not for you, or if there's another session that you want to check out, too!
- **Dress Code**: TransportationCamp has always been a very casual event, especially via the virtual format. We've always said, your best attire is your coolest transportation tee shirt!

## Organizing Committee

TransportationCamp PHL is organized thanks to a collaborative effort between YPT, WTS, and Drexel's Lindy Institute.
Passionate about transportation and bringing the conference to Philadelphia, the conference's co-chairs span a diverse array of subsets in the industry with professional experience in both public and private transportation operations, transportation planning, and logistics consulting.
For additional breadth, the conference has a larger working group whose collective knowledge and expertise spans all facets of the industry and includes all levels of transportation involvement (ranging from career professionals to engaged hobbyists).


## <a name="award"></a> The TCPHL Academic Innovation Award

Now accepting submissions for the 2022 TransportationCamp PHL Emerging Innovators Award presented by David Klahr Consulting!

#### *About the Award*

Returning for a third year, TransportationCamp PHL is pleased to announce the **2022 TransportationCamp PHL Emerging Innovators Award presented by David Klahr Consulting**! This award, the first of its kind ever offered by a TransportationCamp when introduced in 2020, challenges students to prepare a slide deck or short paper addressing one of five topics

> 1. SEPTA Regional Rail, one of the finest systems in the country, isn’t being used to its full potential and is in a post-COVID ridership crisis.<br><br>SEPTA is in the midst of reimagining the Regional Rail service with a long-term vision, but immediate changes are needed to ensure the system survives long enough to complete the plan.<br><br>What short-term changes would you make to immediately improve the viability and attractiveness of Regional Rail?
> <br>
> 
> 2. Philadelphia is facing a large increase of disorderly behavior on its transit system. This is having a big effect on quality of life.<br><br>How can SEPTA increase enforcement of its rules without contributing to unequal treatment of riders based on their race or economic situation? Make sure to include the issue of enforcement of fare payment in your response.<br><br>What does your plan look like to change this in one year?
> <br>
> 
> 3. SEPTA is the largest U.S. transit system without countdown clocks or other real-time information systems for riders.<br><br>Debates about what tech to use and how to buy it have delayed a usable system for years.<br><br>How will you break the logjam and find a way to deliver real-time information for the Market-Frankford and Broad Street Lines? Be sure to consider the project's timeline, scope, required funding, budget timeline, source of capital, upkeep, maintenance, and other relevant details.
> <br>
> 
> 4. As part of their “Bus Revolution”, SEPTA has asked you to get more people to ride the bus. They will measure success by the total number of passengers.<br><br>Unfortunately, the budget has been frozen and you don’t have any additional money.<br><br>Using existing resources, what is the first thing you will do to get more bus riders? You can change anything about current service, but you can't add any new staff or equipment.
> <br>
> 
> 5. What U.S. city has the most under-rated transit service? What is it about this city that makes their way of doing things special?<br><br>What one thing about how they provide services would you bring to Philadelphia or the Mid-Atlantic Region?<br><br>How is it better than current service?

<br>

**The winner shall receive the award, free admission to a future in-person conference, and a generous $500 prize!**
