### TransportationCamp NYC 2023 is returning to Brooklyn!

proposed, and led by attendees like you**. It&#39;s the perfect opportunity to share your transportation passion with a
diverse gathering of individuals from our multidisciplinary industry.

TransportationCamp welcomes all attendees, whether you&#39;re a planner,
software developer, engineer, student, transportation professional, community member, policymaker, or just excited
about mobility!

### Presenting?

Thinking about presenting at a session? Sessions may come in a variety of formats: informal discussions,
birds-of-a-feather, lightning talks, presentations, open space technology, and others. We welcome experts, but really
you just need to care about transportation issues or be nerds about it like us. The important thing is that you bring
your ideas and enthusiasm, and engage! All the breakout rooms are equipped with a projector or whiteboard. We will
be handing out **session idea cards** throughout registration. If you have an idea for a session, feel free to write it
down in advance and bring it with you to the event.

<h3 style="color: #FF6600;">Pre-Camp Happy Hour</h3>
Thanks to our friends at YPT-NYC, we'll be hosting a Happy Hour on Thursday, October 12 at 6pm.
Join us at The Brazen Head in Brooklyn to reacquaint yourself with old friends and meet new ones before Camp on
Saturday! Learn more and
register [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ypt-nyc-x-tcnyc-october-happy-hour-tickets-733145898117?aff=ebdsoporgprofile).

<h3 style="color: #FF6600;">Post-Camp Happy Hour and Pizza Party</h3>
In coordination with WTS-GNY, we’ll be hosting a Happy Hour immediately after Camp at Circa Brewing at 141 Lawrence
Street. However, due to the large number of attendees at Camp this year, **we will need to limit how many people can go
**.
As a result, we will also be hosting a pizza party in the second floor cafe at 5pm for those who aren't able to make it
into the Happy Hour.

We kindly ask that you only sign up to attend the Happy Hour if you are **21 years of age or older**. If you would like
to
attend either the Happy Hour or the Pizza Party, **please fill
out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduKDTKOgC7cbHy-7jwENcLA20L2OsQTJlrfHENK3QAFCNKhQ/viewform)**.

<h3 style="color: #FF6600;">Hudson River Park Bike Tour</h3>
On Sunday, October 15, we'll be hosting a bike tour along the Hudson River Greenway beginning at 1pm. Meet us in front
of the main entrance to the National Museum of the American Indian at 1 Bowling Green in Lower Manhattan. We'll take a
ride to Midtown, pointing out places of interest along the way! Don’t have a bike? That’s okay -- **our starting
location is at a CitiBike dock! Please fill
out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3VsrGemdwN2mFgjnkXLsB170cwiv43mZJQM18QZML-DdYBw/viewform) if
you plan to come!**

<h3 style="color: #FF6600;">MobilityData's North American Workshop</h3>
On October 16 and 17, just after TransportationCamp NYC, MobilityData will be holding their North American Workshop in
New York City! [Register here](https://mobilitydata.org/event/mobilitydata-north-american-workshop/) for this two-day
event dedicated to discussing mobility through the lens of data. This workshop is meant for people who are all about
mobility data, how to standardize it, how to exchange it, and how to leverage it!

information. MobilityData also focuses on creating spaces for knowledge exchange, bringing together public and private
stakeholders to build the mobility of today and tomorrow.
