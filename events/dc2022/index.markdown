[Register now](https://t4america.org/transportation-camp/) for TransportationCamp DC 2022!

Every year, transportation enthusiasts get together on a Saturday in January to share their ideas and map out new possibilities. With new infrastructure legislation soon to pass through Congress, the 2022 virtual TransportationCamp DC will be more important than ever. 

TransportationCamp DC is an annual unconference and important tradition for the transportation community. It is a time for advocates, practitioners, business leaders, professionals, students, and anyone else who might call themselves a “transportation nerd” to gather for this unconference - where attendees plan and lead the sessions themselves - to take stock of where we’re going and how we got here.

Join us this January 8, 2022 for another year of TransportationCamp DC to discuss ways to make our infrastructure safer, more equitable, more sustainable and everything else you can imagine. We’ll be convening virtually once again this year using Zoom and Slack. After you register, watch your inbox for more information, including how to submit your session ideas between **January 3 – 7, 2022**.
