Whether you’re working on transportation, studying transportation planning, or advocating for a system that works better for all, **join us at TransportationCamp DC on Saturday, January 7, 2023 at Van Metre Hall on George Mason University’s Arlington campus.** [Register here.](https://t4america.org/transportation-camp/)

This year’s event will include a virtual option, allowing attendees to view the keynote, select hybrid sessions, and virtual-only sessions from the comfort of their own homes.

National trends continue to present new challenges for our transportation system. Severe weather events fueled by climate change call for resilient infrastructure and more opportunities for low-emissions travel. U.S. traffic deaths continue to rise, even when fewer drivers are on the road. Transit agencies are still recovering from a reduced workforce and decreased revenues. [Join the event](http://t4america.org/transportation-camp) to connect with advocates, experts, and decision makers to renew your work and find ways to make transportation work better for all.

Are you a student? You can attend TransportationCamp for $35! Use code STUDENT23 at checkout for $15 off your general admission ticket.

Volunteers get in free. Email abigail.grimminger@t4america.org if you’re interested in volunteering. (You must be attending in person to volunteer.)
